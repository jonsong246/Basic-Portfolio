                        My name is Jonathan Song and I am currently a Senior 3D Animation Major at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York.
                        
                        I am originally from Orange County, California and I moved to the big city to further enhance my experience as a Digital Arts Student.
                        
                        Here you will find a collection of my work primarily constructed through various software including Autodesk Maya, Adobe Premiere, Photoshop, and Aftereffects. 
                        
                        This is a composition of my projects throughout the course of my academic years here in New York.
                        
                        Through the creation of this webpage, I am able to showcase my work and hope to deliver some insight as well as receive constructive feedback. 
                        
                        Thank you for visiting my page! If you have an questions or comments, you can reach me at jonsong246@gmail.com</p></center>
